    I am a 4-th year B.Tech student at the
    <a href="https://nitdgp.ac.in/department/BT">
        Department of Biotechnology
    </a>
    ,
    <a href="https://nitdgp.ac.in/home">
        National Institute of Technology, Durgapur
    </a>
    , West Bengal, India. I am broadly interested in computational
    immune-oncology, computational genomics, biomedical imaging (Convex
    Optimization based problems) and personalized drug designing.

<p><strong>ON-GOING PROJECTS:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Machine Learning for molecular property and structure prediction</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Supervisor: Dr. Debojyoti De </strong></p>
<p>In this project we are using the ChemProt database for molecular property and structure prediction mainly with RDKit, PyBioMed and ChemoPy. &nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Statistical Analysis of group-structured biological data by joint lasso regression.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Supervisor: Dr. Gautam Bandyopadhyay</strong></p>
<p>We are trying to find out the significance of joint lasso regression for statistical analysis of group-structured biological data by comparing it with fused lasso regression. We are using here cancer gene expression (DNA microarray) datasets.</p>
